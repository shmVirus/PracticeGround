These programming problems cover fundamental concepts and functionalities across programming languages, enabling easy transition among languages. Additional contributions are welcome, prioritizing conciseness and avoiding redundancy.

1. **Absolute Basics**: *Comments, Variables, Operators, Input / Output*
    1. Write a program to greet the user with their name.
    2. Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice-versa.
    3. Write a program to find the area of Circle, Triangle and Rectangle.
2. **Control Flow**: *Conditions, Loops, Switch-Case*
    1. Write a guessing game with how many tries were needed.
    2. Write a program to calculate the sum of digits of a number.
    3. Write a program to find the largest among three numbers.
    4. Write a program to display student grades using switch cases.
3. **Data Structures**: *Array, String*
    1. Write a program that tests whether a string is a palindrome.
    2. Write a program that reverses an array, preferably in place.
    3. Write a program to remove duplicate numbers from an array.
    4. Return difference between largest and smallest element in an array.
    5. Write a program that merges two different arrays into a new sorted array.
4. **Functions**: *Recursion, Lambda*
    1. Write a program to find the GCD and LCM of two numbers.
    2. Find the power of a number using different loops and recursion.
    3. Find factorial of a given number using different loops and recursion.
    4. Write a function that prints first n numbers of Fibonacci sequence.
5. **Pointers and References**:
    1. Write a program that swaps the values of two variables using pointers.
    2. Return the maximum and minimum values using references from the array.
6. **File and Database**:
    1. Write a program that reads data from a file, performs some calculations, and writes the results to another file.
    2. Implement a program that searches for a specific string in a text file and counts its occurrences.
    3. Create a program that connects to a database, retrieves data from a table, and displays it.
    4. Implement a program that allows users to insert, update, and delete records in a database table.
7. **Exception Handling**:
    1. Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and performs division, handling the exception when the denominator is zero.
    2. Implement a function that reads a file and handles exceptions for file opening and reading errors.
8. **Object-Oriented Programming**:
    1. Create a class representing a Bank Account. Implement methods to deposit, withdraw, and display the account balance.
    2. Implement a class hierarchy for different types of vehicles, such as Car, Motorcycle, and Truck. Include common attributes and behaviors, and specific attributes and behaviors for each vehicle type.
